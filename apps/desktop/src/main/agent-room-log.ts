 * the host never posted (the daemon's task reports), so a row's place comes
 * from the read, never from who posted it or from its `at` (a report carries
 * the time it was queued, not posted). A posted row the read lacks sits
 * before the window when a later posted row is in it (it fell out of the
 * tail), and after it otherwise (the read has not caught up with it). With no
