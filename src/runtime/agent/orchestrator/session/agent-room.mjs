// session/agent-room.mjs
// A group room: the user and several agents in ONE chat. The room's log is an
// ordinary session (`sess_room_<id>`), so transcripts, read cursors, unread
// counts and phone sync work unchanged; every row in it is posted, never a
// turn. Each member runs in its own persistent session per room
// (`sess_rmem_<room>_<agent>`) and is handed only the rows new since it last
// spoke. What another agent said reaches a member as DATA inside an explicit
// boundary, with every harness tag escaped and every line relabelled, so a peer
// can never forge a control frame or pose as the user. Files come with the
// user's own rows and with a member's speech (the files its turn produced,
// session-runtime/handoff-attachments.mjs): stored references, handed as
// content to the members the row reaches, once each.

 * peer a speech addressed. Members the user addressed (`to`) answer first,
 * once each, in that order; cut by the message cap, the result lists the ones
 * still owed a turn (`remaining`). After that, each step asks
 * `decide({ mustPick, turns, last, mention, remaining })` for the next speaker:
 * `{ action: 'speak', agentId, instruction?, scene? }` or `{ action: 'finish' }`;
 * the newest decision's scene ('casual' or 'work') holds for the turns after
 * it, 'work' until a step names one (so the members the user addressed answer
 * as at work). A decision `{ action: 'unmanaged' }` (no Maintainer model)
 * ends the exchange after the called members' turns, or, for a user's call to
 * the whole room, after one turn for every member in order. A failed or
 * invalid decision falls back deterministically (nextSpeaker), and
 * until some member has spoken the exchange cannot finish, so a user waiting
 * for an answer is never left in silence. The caps stay hard: `maxMessages`
 * bounds speeches, and `maxRounds` × members bounds the supervisor's steps (a
 * round's worth of turns per round). `waiting` (default true): the user's
 * newest message has no answer yet. Without it (a "Continue" after the talk
 * was answered) no step must pick: the supervisor may finish at once, and
 * members who all pass end the exchange. Once every other member has passed since
 * the newest speech, nobody has anything to add and the exchange finishes
 * ('done') instead of handing quiet members turns until a cap; the rounds cap
 * reached after nothing but passes since the last speech is 'done' too, not a
 * cap. The exchange ends when the supervisor finishes ('done'), at a cap
 * ('capped', `limit` names which), on a stop ('stopped'), or, at any step
 * boundary after a newer user message arrives, 'superseded'. A turn answers
 * 'superseded' when a newer user message cut it short: it leaves no trace and
