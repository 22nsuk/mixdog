 * Existence probes that never conflate "not there" with "cannot look".

 * therefore reads a temporarily unreadable file as a DELETED one: the sweep
 * queues its summary row for removal, sidecar rebuilds drop it, sidecars get
 * unlinked as orphans and in-memory state is allowed to stand in for it.
 * Absence is a fact; a failed probe is an unknown, and an unknown may never
