# HTML route (Excel report sheets)

Owns the default route for a new workbook's report surface: the model designs each sheet in HTML and CSS and passes the document as `author`'s `script`; a local Chrome or Edge lays it out; the runtime cuts a column grid at every edge the browser drew (a card's border, a table's cells, a chart's frame) and writes native Excel on it — column widths and row heights as drawn, values and live formulas in their type and number format, merges across the cells a text spans, fills and rules, Excel tables, native charts over the cells, notes. Nothing is a picture of a cell. The approach is jsreport html-to-xlsx's (computed styles read from Chrome) widened from one `<table>` to a whole designed page (a CSS grid of cards, a table beside a chart), set on Mixdog's own writer so the recalculation, audit, brief, and review apply unchanged.

## 1. The call
`office action:'author' path:<file.xlsx> script:<html> [overwrite:true] [mode:'portable'|'background'] [render:false]`
- Returns `session`, `audit`, `logs` (what could not be carried, each naming its element), and unless `render:false` the rendered pages with `render.reviewToken` and `render.compare`: per sheet, the browser's drawing of the section on the left and the Excel render on the right.
- The HTML is kept as `<file>.xlsx.mixdog-source.html`. **Default — fix by editing that file** and calling `author path:<file.xlsx>` with no `script`.
- After landing, the workbook is an ordinary session: `batch`, `render`, `qa`, `finalize` as SKILL.md describes; `finalize` recalculates and refuses formula errors. A `<!-- BRIEF … -->` comment (`subject/audience/action`, `sources`, `facts`) holds the sheet to its facts and asks the scored critique at finalize.

## 2. Workbook contract
**Hard rule — one section per worksheet**: `<section data-sheet="보고">` is a sheet named 보고, in document order. Without one the call is refused. → runtime `html_failed`
**Hard rule — the numbers live**: every derived figure is `data-formula`, never typed. The element's text is what the browser shows (write the expected result so the HTML reads right); the cell holds the formula.
| HTML | Excel |
|---|---|
| a text block (`p`, a `div` of text) | its value in the top-left cell, merged across the cells its box spans, in its face, size, weight, colour, and alignment; several lines wrap |
| `data-formula="=SUMIFS(Ops[처리량],Ops[월],{m6})"` | a live formula; `{id}` is the cell the element with that `id` landed on (qualified with its sheet when it stands on another) |
| `data-value="2026-06-01"` `data-format='m"월"'` | the stored value and its number format (a date stays a date: `m"월"` shows 6월 and still sorts and computes) |
| `data-note="자료: …"` | the cell's note: the figure's source or assumption |
| `<td>` text `184,200`, `+12.0%`, `2026-09-30` | a number or date in the format it was written in (`#,##0`, `+0.0%`, `yyyy-mm-dd`) |
| `<table>` | cells on the grid the browser drew, `th` and `thead` as headers; `colspan`/`rowspan` merge |
| `<table data-table="Ops" data-freeze="header">` | an Excel table named Ops (structured references `Ops[처리량]`; no merges inside it), its header frozen and repeated in print |
| a block's `background`, `border-*` | cell fills and per-side rules over the cells it covers (a card is a filled block of cells) |
| `<div data-chart='{…}' data-range="{mh}:{m9},{wh}:{w9}">` | a native chart over those cells: the first area the categories, each next one a series, each from its header down |
| `data-chart` with `labels`/`values` and no `data-range` | a native chart over a hidden `차트 데이터` sheet holding those values |
| `<img>`, inline `<svg>`, `<canvas>` | a picture at its laid-out size (`alt` or `data-alt` is its alt text) |
| on the section: `data-freeze="5"`, `data-gridlines="show"`, `data-orientation="landscape"`, `data-fit="page"`, `data-hidden="true"` | frozen rows above row 5, gridlines on (off by default), print orientation, one printed page, a hidden sheet |

Chart spec keys: `type` (`col`, `bar`, `line`, `area`, `pie`, `doughnut`), `colors` (one series in two colours, one of them used once, is that bar highlighted and the rest muted), `format` (value labels, `0"분"`), `showValues`, `legend`, `grid`, `valueAxis`, `title` (or `data-title`). The chart takes the box the browser drew; give it a height.
Each sheet prints one page wide (a report sheet one page), orientation from its proportions unless set, with its print area at its content.
**Not carried** (reported in `logs`): text beside child blocks (wrap it in its own element), merges inside a `data-table`, `position: absolute|fixed` (placed where it lies — check the cell it lands on), underline and strikethrough, border radius and shadows.

## 3. Design
- **Report and data apart**: the report sheet is designed — eyebrow, assertion title, a row of two to four figure cards (`display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)`), then a table beside its chart (`grid-template-columns: 380px 1fr`) and a sourced note. Each figure is a formula over the table; the table's figures are formulas over the data sheet; the data sheet is one `data-table` with a frozen header. `references/report-design.md` owns the sheet roles and the acceptance; `${MIXDOG_SKILL_DIR}/../pptx/references/direction.md` §5-§6 the palette and type.
- **Sizes in px on a fixed width**: the report section has a width (`width: 1060px`) and padding; Excel's grid is cut from it, so a layout left to the window's width lands on the window's. Type 11-14 px for cells, 20-26 px for a title and card figures; one face for Hangul and figures (`'Malgun Gothic'`).
- **Ids name the cells**: give every cell a formula or a chart reads an `id` (`m6`, `v6`), the header cells a chart range starts at too (`{mh}:{m9}`), and write formulas and ranges with them — never a guessed `B15`.
- Avoid the generated look `${MIXDOG_SKILL_DIR}/../pptx/references/html.md` §8 lists (identical shaded boxes everywhere, decorative colour with no job, centred everything).

## 4. Review
Read every `render.compare` pair: the left is what the HTML meant, the right what Excel drew. A card's fill or span, a column's width, a chart's place, or a value's format that differs is fixed in the HTML (or reported). Snapshot the report sheet once to confirm the formulas and their values, then finalize as SKILL.md §3 step 5.
